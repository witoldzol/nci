Object theory

       Use case Diagram:
       
       -actors: anything outside system that interacts with the system
       -system  boundary
       - use cases // (verbs - actions)
       -no concept of time 

USE CASE: -sequence of transations performed by the system
    	  -represents one way to use the system by an actor
    	  -initiated by the actor
	  -describes the dialogue between an Actor and the system
	  -don't have to interact with the initializing agent
	  -LOG IN is not a USE CASE in itself // you don't log in jsut for the sake of itself//
	  -provides meaningful, measurable VALUE to an actor

Actor is not an USER !
      Actor is a role, not a particular person
      Particular person can be a number of actors and vice versa.

      Actor categories:
      -primary // person for whom the system is designed for, atm user (human)
      -secondary // people who perform secondary functions in system, for example, sys admin (human)
      -external hardware (non human) eg. printer
      -other systems that interact with our system

******************************

LEARN USE CASE TEMPLATE to describe use case!
      -preconditions ! (have i crashed? have i crashed? ..no no yes -> deploy airbags)
      -postconditions
      
******************************

When describing use case actions, use ACTIVE VERBS
     eg. present actor with a menu
     	 give actor money

-------------------- WEEK 4 ----------

CLASS DIAGRAMS:
      describes objects(classes)
      there is no sense of time in this diagram
      we will concentrate on CONCEPTUAL perspective
      we use NOUNS in this diagram to name concepts (use case used verbs)
      made out of boxes:
      	   -attributes that class has
	   -methods (operations) that class has / can do


Relationships(btw classes)
	-have to have a NAME !!!
	-0..1 to * (many) etc


Generalization: (raltionship, no need to be named)

	-"is a" relationship
	-you abstract common attributes from min two classes and put them into 'super'
	class
	-arrow with a white head

Whole / Part Aggregations (relationship, no need to name)

      -"is one obj part of another whole obj?"
      -full arrowhead
      
Composition (??)


-------------------- PROJECT --------------------

Describe individually ONE use case

Interim: up to point 5 !!!

One hardcopy and one online copy via moodle

dont use:
(no dependency relationships!)
(no association class)
(naming objects) dont bother with underlining and colons


---------------------------------------- PROJECT MANAGEMENT CLASS ----------

Project is temporary
One time effort (as opposed to Operations -ongoing)

Project sponsor: provides direction and funds.

Triple constraints:
       -Scope
       -Time
       -Cost
