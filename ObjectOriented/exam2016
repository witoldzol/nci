i) Describe with the aid of an example the concept of inheritance

   Inharitance relates to objects / classes. The idea is that parent class has common
   attributes that can be found in all it's 'child' classes.
   For example, class Animal will be a parent to class of cat and dog. Animal class will
   have common behaviour / attributes that can be found in cat and dog classes. For example,
   animal class will have size attribute, fur (boolean), sound method.
   Both dog and cat attribut will have access to those methods and attributes.

   Inheritance reduces duplication of methods, and allows reusability of code.

ii) Using examples compare Concept Class diagrams with Design Class diagrams.

    Concept class diagram focuses on concepts and real life application / associations.
    Design class diagram is closer to the software side, and focuses on actual attributes/
    methods in particular classes, and how they are associated with each other.

iii) Explain the processes behind ranking and scheduling use classes:

     First, UC are allocated to development cycles.
     Ranking helps determine what to work on first.
     classes can be ranked by variuos attributes. For example, they can be ranked by
     priority: high, medium, low. This will determine scheduling of classes and when
     they should be designed/implemented in the project. The most important classes are
     usually created and tested firs, as the architecture of the system depends on them etc.

     
iv) Describe the Expert Pattern

    Design patterns are universal solutions/patterns to problems we encounter in design
    over and over again. Applies to all disciplines, not just software dev.

    Expert pattern answers question: -what object / class should be responsible for
    executing given task?
    Answer: responsibility should be with object that has all the necessary information
    / data to perform given task

    Example: Sales object/ class, which contains info on all line items, should be in charge
    of calculating the total amt to be paid.

    Whereas lineItem class, should be in charge of calculating subtotals, as it has access
    to specific items (and their price per unit)


v)  In the context of project planning, why would one plan?

    History is full of failed projects.
    Objective of the project is to deliver a product, within given time and money
    constraint.
    If project fails to meet all objectives, it can be considered failure.


    Without planning, it would be difficult to organize work, to divide it and prioritize
    most important parts.
    weak planning results in inefficiencies, wasted time and money.

    Few rules: plan before coding. revise plan every time new things have to be included.
    don't add new features unless absolutely necessary (feature creep).
