---------------------------------	TCP / IP ------------------------------

5 Layers:
  Application	//	
  Transport	//	TCP	(cares about lost data, resends data, can requests packets)
    		//		eg. does 'handshaking' between your browser and server
  Network	//	IP	(just keeps sending packets) (doesn't replay packets)
  Data link	//	
  Physical	//

--------------------

Ethernet address (MAC - Media Access Control

Ethernet checksum : to verify if the data has been corrupted along the way.
If it was, packet gets dropped

ETHERNET FRAME:
//Destination address // Source address // PDU // Data + padding // CRC(checksum) //
min 64 bytes
max 1518 bytes

******************************
Broadcast:
sent by a machine looking for a specific IP address
every machine in the netweork listens to it, and the with matching ethernet
address will respond to it. That's how machines identify target of their message.

--------------------
ARP
- used only for local networks / lans
- not secure // see ARP poisonoing //
- creates relationship between layer 2 & 3



Command:
arp -a
    // level 3 (ip)
    // gives you an ARP cache where are stored arp's // gets STALE quickly (5 min or so)
    	 

gives list of relationships between internet addressess and physical addresses;
ARP are stored temporarily so that the machine doesn't have to generate it all over again when broadcasting.

hub: creates relationship between layer 1 and 2. Looks at ports.

Full Duplex cables: you can send and receive at the same time;

---------------------------------------- CABLES --------------------

Guided cables
-wired
	-twisted-pair cable
		      // cheapest and most popular
		      //its twisted to lower the degradation of packets over time/space
		      //STP - shielded twisted pair (shielding reduces noise from outside)
		      
	-coaxial cable

	-fiber-optic cable

Ungaided cables
	-wireless

----- ******************** EXAM QUESTION: EXPLAIN TYPES OF SIGNAL DEGREDATION

You need to be able to explaine those:

- Attenuation

- Crosstalk

- Noise


----------------------------------------

1 = 5v
0 = 0v

Signal wire Tx = 5V + noise volt
Ground wire Rx = 0V + noise volt

Reciever substracts Rx from Tx, this way noise is cancelled out at the end
	 //called as DIFFERENTIAL SIGNALING //
	 //thats why wires are twisted, so their path is identical and they
	 will be subject to the same noise, so it can be eliminated.
	 if the wires were straight they would have differnt paths, hence they would
	 collect different noise, and it ouwld be impossible to cancel out the noise
	 at the end //

UTP: unshielded twisted pair
STP: shielded twisted pair // actual shielding is minimal and cost increase is
     	      	      	   // minimal


//windows

COMMAND:
----------
netstat -na

:you will get local ips and foreign addresses
    each ip will have a POET number
    	 DIRECTION of connections (from high PORT numbers to low POrt nb)
    	 when we connect to server, that server has a well known port number
	 our port number is a generic number, whereas server (facebook) will have a
	 -	 well known port number


COMMAND:
----------
ipconfig/all

	will tell you:
	
	    - ethernet address
	      	       (physical address: 00-50-56-92-1D-EC)
	      	      (( layer 2 address - have to be unique or you will have a conflict))
	    - IPv4 address:
	      	   that's our ip address

	    - TCP / UDP address (no such thing on a card!)
	    	      (they are allocated to connections)

	    - Default Gateway

******************************  POTENTIAL EXAM QUESTION ********************

----COAXIAL CALBE (guided media)
	high bandwidth cable (can carry 10k voice signals)
	they have existed for a long time for TV
	construction: 2 electrical conductors (inner & outer - outer/ shield is the ground)
		      btw 2 conductors there is plastic which insulates them from each other
		      outside there is plastic cover

------------------------------ dont learn categories of coaxial cable ----------
advantages:
	-cheap to install compared to optic fiber
	-wide bandwidth than twisted pair
	-suitable for TV etc
	-conforms to standards

disadvantages:
	-limited distance
	-bulty and difficult to install
	-limited number of connections
	-terminators/connectors have to be done properly (vampire connects etc)
	-optical fibre is more cost-effective over long links
	-UTP is more cost effective on short distances



----FIBRE OPTIC CABLE (guided media)
	  near unlimited bandwidth
	  construction: core (glass) covered in cladding ( glass ) covered in plastic jacket
	  light refrects (bounces off) from ouside glass while running through inner core
	  dont learn: bending of light rays (won't come up on exam)
	  multimode fibre: cheaper version, signal gets distorted way more over long lengths
	  single mode: expensive
	  dont learn fiber types / step index ...

advantages: immune to electromagnetic interferences
	    vary big bandwidth / capacity
	    

disadvantages: costly
	       difficult to repair
	       fragile
	       difficult to join fibres in the field


----- TCP / IP review

Transport layer
Network layer
	duties:
		
		:Internetworking
		:Packetizing
		:Addressing
		:Routing
		:Fragmenting
		
-multicasting
-routing protocols
-address resolution

---------- Peer to Peer
	   from the same level / layer to the same layer (at the same level)


---Internet layer:
	    -IP protocol is used
	    -IP is unreliable and connection-less protocol
	    	:connection-oriented (telephone for example - you get dedicated channel)
		:ip is not like phone service, they don't care how data is structured /
		organized / in what order it reaches target
	    -IP has no error checking / tracking
	    -sends data in packets called datagrams
	    -datagrams may travel over different routs (can arrive out of order/ get lost)
	    -no facility for re-ordering the datagrams upon arrival
	    

datagram ( packet )
no ipv4 datagram header description

******************** EXAM:

---IPv4 Addressing
	fourth version of ip addressing scheme
	(there is a finate nb of possible combinations)

Information in the IP address:
	    class:
		-based on the first digits
		-there are 5 classes: A,B,C,D,E
		-convert first byte into bits, and determine class (0=A,10 =B,11=C)

0-127		A: - governments / huge organisations
128-191		B: - medium to large companies
		   Both classes are often wasteful (assigned to orgs that don't use thime)
192-223		C: - small organizations / companies
224-239		D: - for multicasting
240-255		E: - special purpose

Class A: netid - 1st byte, host id -3bytes
Class B: netid - 1st & 2nd byte; host id: 3rd & 4th
Class C: netid - 1st/2nd & 3rd byte; host id: 4th;
Class D: group address only
Class E: undefined

So for example:

ipconfig/all
ipv4: 192.168.144.93
      class: C
      netid: 192.168.144
      host id: = 93      
      network address: = 192.168.144.0

********************   NETWORK ID IS NOT THE SAME AS NETWORK ADDRESS ********************

---Direct broadcast address
       example:
	net id: 192.168.144
	net address: 192.168.144.0
	direct broadcast: 192.168.144.255

Two addresses are reserved by default  x.x.x.0 and x.x.x.255

---Limited Broadcast:
	   -255.255.255.255
	   -used only locally within network


----Excercise:
	IP address: 183.121.56.4

class:	B
netid:	183.121
hostid: 56.4
network address: 183.121.0.0
direct broadcast address: 183.121.255.255
limited broadcast address: 255.255.255.255
default subnet mask for class B = 255.255.0.0



----------     SUBNETWORKS

example:
4.34.23.4
class A
net id: 4
hostid 34.23.4
network address: 4.0.0.0
subnet mask: 255.0.0.0

no. 3 bytes = 2^24 hosts  (16 mil)

----------------------- Excercise:
break up the above network into 256 buildings:

1) come up with a subnet mask : 255.255.0.0

2)
	building 1: 4.0.0.0
	building 2: 4.1.0.0
	buiiding 3: 4.2.0.0
	building 4: 4.3.0.0
	building 256: 4.255.0.0

	(so effectively we broken up class A network into 256 class B networks)

----------------------- EXAM EXCERCISE:

172.20.2.38

class B:
net address 172.20.0.0
direct broadcast 172.20.255.255
default subnet mask: 255.255.0.0
