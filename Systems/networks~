---------------------------------	TCP / IP ------------------------------

5 Layers:
  Application	//	
  Transport	//	TCP	(cares about lost data, resends data, can requests packets)
    		//		eg. does 'handshaking' between your browser and server
  Network	//	IP	(just keeps sending packets) (doesn't replay packets)
  Data link	//	
  Physical	//

--------------------

Ethernet address (MAC - Media Access Control

Ethernet checksum : to verify if the data has been corrupted along the way.
If it was, packet gets dropped

ETHERNET FRAME:
//Destination address // Source address // PDU // Data + padding // CRC(checksum) //
min 64 bytes
max 1518 bytes

******************************
Broadcast:
sent by a machine looking for a specific IP address
every machine in the netweork listens to it, and the with matching ethernet
address will respond to it. That's how machines identify target of their message.

--------------------
ARP
- used only for local networks / lans
- not secure // see ARP poisonoing //
- creates relationship between layer 2 & 3



Command:
arp -a   // gives you an ARP cache where are stored arp's // gets STALE quickly (5 min or so)
    	 

gives list of relationships between internet addressess and physical addresses;
ARP are stored temporarily so that the machine doesn't have to generate it all over again when broadcasting.

hub: creates relationship between layer 1 and 2. Looks at ports.

Full Duplex cables: you can send and receive at the same time;

---------------------------------------- CABLES --------------------

Guided cables
-wired
	-twisted-pair cable
		      // cheapest and most popular
		      //its twisted to lower the degradation of packets over time/space
		      //STP - shielded twisted pair (shielding reduces noise from outside)
		      
	-coaxial cable

	-fiber-optic cable

Ungaided cables
	-wireless

----- ******************** EXAM QUESTION: EXPLAIN TYPES OF SIGNAL DEGREDATION

You need to be able to explaine those:

- Attenuation

- Crosstalk

- Noise


----------------------------------------

1 = 5v
0 = 0v

Signal wire Tx = 5V + noise volt
Ground wire Rx = 0V + noise volt

Reciever substracts Rx from Tx, this way noise is cancelled out at the end
	 //called as DIFFERENTIAL SIGNALING //
	 //thats why wires are twisted, so their path is identical and they
	 will be subject to the same noise, so it can be eliminated.
	 if the wires were straight they would have differnt paths, hence they would
	 collect different noise, and it ouwld be impossible to cancel out the noise
	 at the end //

UTP: unshielded twisted pair
STP: shielded twisted pair // actual shielding is minimal and cost increase is
     	      	      	   // minimal
