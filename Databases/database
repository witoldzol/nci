	****************************************

How to normalize:

1) find out how business collects data

2) we will use THREE 'Normal forms' : we do this to remove duplication

   I) write out all fields (UNF)
   II) identify in the data that can identify classes uniqly (find out keys) and break up fields into separate tables (1NF)
   III) check if everything is dependentend on the primary key & related to it! (2NF)
   IV) compound key = collection of primary keys that create compound key.
